Tammy Baldwin “voted to send hundreds of millions to Iran” to bankroll “radicals like Hezbollah and Hamas.”,National Republican Senatorial Committee,"November 24, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Senator Tammy Baldwin did vote in favor of the Iran nuclear deal, which did result in Iran gaining access to frozen assets. However, it's misleading to say she voted to ""send hundreds of millions to Iran"" as if it was a direct transaction. Furthermore, the claim that this money was used to bankroll ""radicals like Hezbollah and Hamas"" is speculative and not directly supported by evidence."

However, it lacks specific data or sources to verify the claim that this particular Thanksgiving dinner is the ""fourth-cheapest ever as a percentage of average earnings."" Without this information, it's difficult to fully confirm the accuracy of the statement."
15,Jeff Cercone,These 13 books “have been banned from schools in Florida.”,Pink,"November 20, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it's possible that some books have been banned from schools in Florida, the statement doesn't specify which 13 books are being referred to, nor does it provide any context or reasons for the ban. The banning of books in schools is a complex issue that often involves various factors such as content appropriateness, parental consent, and educational relevance. Without these details, it's difficult to fully assess the accuracy of the statement."
16,Louis Jacobson,"""Half of American high school students are not familiar with the Holocaust.""",Dean Phillips,"November 20, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it is true that some American high school students may not be fully educated about the Holocaust, stating that half of them are not familiar with it is a broad generalization. The level of knowledge can vary greatly depending on the curriculum, the state, and the individual student's interest in history."
18,Ciara O'Rourke,Princess Diana “is still alive” and “possibly could be with Trump.”,Viral image,"November 17, 2023",pants-fire,pants-fire,"The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Princess Diana died in a car crash in 1997, which is a well-documented fact. The claim that she could be with Trump is also baseless and lacks any credible evidence."
23,Sophia Voight,"U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson ""opposes Social Security benefits.""",Francesca Hong,"November 17, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Mike Johnson may have opposed certain aspects or reforms of Social Security, but it's unlikely that he opposes the entire concept of Social Security benefits. The statement needs more context to be fully understood."
24,Maria Briceño,Ron DeSantis “wants to cut Social Security and Medicare.”,DeSantis Watch,"November 16, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"While it's true that Ron DeSantis has supported policies that could lead to cuts in Social Security and Medicare, it's not accurate to say he ""wants"" to cut these programs. His stance is more about reducing the deficit and debt, which could involve changes to these programs, but it's not a direct desire to cut them."
25,Louis Jacobson,“Abraham Lincoln challenged a guy to a sword fight.”,Markwayne Mullin,"November 16, 2023",half-true,Mostly-true,"While it sounds like a tall tale, there is historical evidence that Abraham Lincoln, before he became president, was challenged to a duel by a political rival, James Shields. However, as the one challenged, Lincoln had the right to choose the weapons and he humorously chose broadswords, hoping to dissuade Shields with his superior reach. The duel never actually took place as friends intervened and resolved the dispute. So, while Lincoln did technically choose swords for a duel, it's misleading to say he ""challenged a guy to a sword fight"" as it implies a more aggressive action than what actually happened."

However, without specific data from the mentioned year, it's hard to confirm the exact figure of $178 billion. The amount of damage can vary greatly from year to year depending on the severity and frequency of the disasters."
33,Paul Specht,“This map was drawn entirely in secret by an Ohio consultant … with taxpayer dollars.”,Eric Ager,"November 15, 2023",mostly-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate. It is true that the map could have been drawn by a consultant, possibly in secret, and it could have been funded by taxpayer dollars. However, the statement leaves out important details such as the purpose of the map, the context in which it was drawn, and the specific circumstances under which it was funded by taxpayer dollars. Without these details, it's hard to fully assess the truthfulness of the statement."
37,Samantha Putterman,"An exemption in a new Florida law “allowed Chinese nationals to buy land within a 20-mile radius of a military base, lobbied for by one of (Gov. Ron DeSantis’) donors.”",Vivek Ramaswamy,"November 15, 2023",half-true,False,"The statement is not accurate. There is no evidence or credible source that supports the claim that a new Florida law allows Chinese nationals to buy land within a 20-mile radius of a military base, or that such a provision was lobbied for by a donor to Gov. Ron DeSantis. This seems to be a misinterpretation or fabrication of the law's content."
39,Louis Jacobson,"“We sell arms to 60% of the world's autocrats. We are the world's largest arms exporters.""",Marianne Williamson,"November 14, 2023",true,mostly-true,"The statement is accurate in that the United States is indeed the world's largest arms exporter. However, the exact percentage of arms sold to autocrats can vary and is not easily verifiable. The term ""autocrat"" can also be subjective and depends on how one defines an autocratic regime."
40,Sarah Bahari,“We produce a lot more wind energy in Texas than California does.”,Ted Cruz,"November 14, 2023",true,True,"Texas is the leading state in the United States for wind power production, with the largest installed wind energy capacity. As of 2020, Texas had more than 30,000 megawatts of wind power, while California had around 6,000 megawatts. Therefore, the statement is accurate."
44,Ciara O'Rourke,A “B-2 stealth bomber seen over New York” means “Hezbollah may declare war on Israel.”,TikTok posts,"November 10, 2023",pants-fire,false,The statement is not accurate. The sighting of a B-2 stealth bomber over New York does not directly imply that Hezbollah may declare war on Israel. These are two separate events and one does not necessarily cause or indicate the other. The author is making a speculative connection without providing any substantial evidence or context.
48,Ciara O'Rourke,“Jews did 9/11.”,Instagram posts,"November 10, 2023",pants-fire,pants-fire,"This statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. It promotes a conspiracy theory that is not supported by any credible evidence. The 9/11 attacks were carried out by the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda, as confirmed by multiple investigations, including the 9/11 Commission Report."

We said if you return nuclear missiles that were part of the old Soviet Union to Russia, and they invade you, we will protect you.”",Chris Christie,"November 9, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate. The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, signed in 1994, did involve Ukraine giving up its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal in exchange for assurances of its sovereignty and territorial integrity from the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia. However, the agreement did not explicitly promise military protection or intervention from the U.S. or U.K. in the event of an invasion. It was more of a political commitment rather than a binding security guarantee."
52,Ciara O'Rourke,Video shows someone wearing a Donald Trump mask appeared in court instead of the former president.,Viral image,"November 9, 2023",pants-fire,False,The statement is not accurate. There is no record or credible report of someone wearing a Donald Trump mask appearing in court instead of the former president. This seems like a misinterpretation or fabrication of events.

58,Tyler Katzenberger,Wisconsin elections administrator Meagan Wolfe “refuses to clean up our voter rolls”,"Wisconsin Election Committee, Inc .","November 8, 2023",pants-fire,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate. Meagan Wolfe, as Wisconsin's chief election official, does have a role in managing the state's voter rolls. However, the statement implies that she is neglecting her duties or intentionally allowing inaccuracies to persist, which is a misrepresentation. The process of maintaining voter rolls is complex and involves many factors, including federal laws and regulations, state laws, and local administration. It's not solely up to Wolfe to ""clean up"" the voter rolls."
60,Tyler Katzenberger,Wisconsin elections administrator Meagan Wolfe “permitted the ‘Zuckerbucks’ influence money.”,"Wisconsin Election Committee, Inc .","November 8, 2023",pants-fire,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. It's true that Wisconsin, like many other states, received funding from the Center for Tech and Civic Life, a nonprofit that received a large donation from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, for election administration in 2020. However, the term ""Zuckerbucks"" is a pejorative term used by some critics of this funding, and the statement implies a negative connotation or undue influence without providing evidence or context. Furthermore, Meagan Wolfe, as an administrator, would not have sole authority to permit or deny such funding."
63,Ciara O'Rourke,“NASA admits space and planets are fake.”,Viral image,"November 8, 2023",pants-fire,pants-fire,"The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is a U.S. government agency that conducts space exploration and research. It has never claimed that space and planets are fake. This is a baseless conspiracy theory."
67,Louis Jacobson,"""Over the past four decades, we’ve lost over 400,000 farms in America (and) over 140 million acres of farmland. And that’s an area roughly equal to the size of Minnesota, North and South Dakota combined.”",Joe Biden,"November 7, 2023",mostly-true,mostly-true,"The statement is mostly accurate. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of farms in the U.S. has indeed decreased significantly over the past few decades. However, the exact numbers may vary depending on the source and the definition of a ""farm"". The comparison of the lost farmland to the size of Minnesota, North and South Dakota combined is a good approximation but may not be entirely accurate."

However, it lacks context and additional information. For instance, it doesn't specify whether these are registered child care providers, or informal arrangements. It also doesn't provide information on what this rate includes, such as meals, educational activities, etc."

77,Louis Jacobson,“Because of our economic policies we now are reducing inflation.”,Kamala Harris,"November 3, 2023",barely-true,mostly-true,"The statement is accurate in that economic policies can indeed influence inflation rates. However, it lacks specific details about which policies are being referred to, and it does not provide any data or evidence to support the claim that inflation is currently being reduced. Therefore, while the statement is generally true, it needs additional information or clarification."
84,Sophia Voight,"Potato chips, KitKat bars and Viagra are not taxed in Wisconsin because they are considered ""essential.""",Melissa Agard,"November 3, 2023",true,False,"The statement is not accurate. While it's true that some states in the U.S. do not tax certain food items, it's unlikely that items like potato chips and KitKat bars would be considered ""essential"" and thus exempt from tax. Furthermore, prescription drugs like Viagra are typically not taxed in many states, but not because they are considered ""essential,"" but because they are prescription medications."

88,Louis Jacobson,“Gen Z is divided 50-50 on whether they support Hamas or Israel.”,Vivek Ramaswamy,"November 2, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. The support for either Hamas or Israel among Gen Z is likely to vary greatly depending on many factors such as geographical location, political beliefs, religious beliefs, and personal experiences. Without specific data or a source to back up this claim, it's hard to say that Gen Z is exactly divided 50-50 on this issue."
89,Anthony Starkey,"Gasoline prices are ""up 63%"" under President Joe Biden.",Chris Rose,"November 2, 2023",half-true,half-true,"While it's true that gasoline prices have increased since President Joe Biden took office, attributing the entire increase to his policies is misleading. Gasoline prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global oil prices, supply and demand, and geopolitical events. It's also important to note that prices were unusually low in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a decrease in demand for gasoline. Therefore, some increase was expected as the economy recovered."

93,Amy Sherman,Gov. Ron DeSantis “actually sponsored the bill to make Puerto Rico a state.”,MAGA Inc,"November 1, 2023",mostly-true,Mostly-true,"While it's true that Ron DeSantis, as a congressman, co-sponsored a bill in 2017 that would have made Puerto Rico a state, the statement could be misleading without this context. The term ""sponsored"" often implies that a person was the primary driver behind a bill, which is not the case here. DeSantis was one of 37 co-sponsors of the bill, not the sole sponsor."

105,Amy Sherman,“The Republicans and Trump funded $400 million in March of 2020 for mail ballots.”,Ron DeSantis,"October 31, 2023",half-true,Mostly-true,"While it's true that in March 2020, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which included $400 million in election assistance, it's not accurate to say that all of this money was specifically for mail ballots. The funds were for states to prepare for the 2020 election during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could include expanding mail-in voting, but also other measures like online registration, early voting, and election worker training. Therefore, the statement needs some clarification."
107,Laura Schulte,"“Wisconsin has historically … and I think largely continues to be, a blue state.”",Scott Walker,"October 31, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"While it is true that Wisconsin has historically leaned Democratic, or ""blue,"" in many elections, it is not entirely accurate to say it ""largely continues to be"" a blue state. The state has shown a trend of being a swing state in recent years, with its electoral votes going to both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates. For instance, in the 2016 Presidential Election, Wisconsin voted for the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. Therefore, the statement leaves out important details about the state's recent political trends."
115,Louis Jacobson,“It is harder to buy Sudafed than an AR-15 in Maine.”,Shannon Watts,"October 27, 2023",half-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it is true that purchasing Sudafed, a common cold medicine, can be regulated due to its use in making illegal drugs, and that in some cases, buying a gun like an AR-15 might not require the same level of scrutiny, the comparison is not entirely fair. The process of buying a gun can vary greatly depending on the seller (private sellers vs. licensed dealers), the buyer's background, and specific state laws. In Maine, private sellers are not required to perform background checks, but licensed dealers are. Therefore, the ease of purchasing an AR-15 can vary."

While it's true that the Milwaukee Brewers have expressed concerns about transit to the ballpark, it's not entirely accurate to say they are ""taking"" money away from Milwaukee County. The Brewers may support a proposal that could result in less funding for transit, but they are not directly responsible for the allocation of county funds. The statement leaves out these important details."

The U.S. national debt does increase every second due to interest and spending, but the exact amount can vary. Without knowing the length of the speech, it's hard to determine if the debt would increase by exactly $20 million."

They were broke.”",Donald Trump,"October 26, 2023",half-true,false,"The statement is not accurate.

Joe Manchin's support for the Inflation Reduction Act could potentially impact fossil fuel jobs in West Virginia. However, the specific number of 100,000 jobs is not substantiated and seems to be an estimate or speculation, not a confirmed fact. The actual impact would depend on various factors including the specifics of the legislation, how it is implemented, and how the fossil fuel industry adapts."

Jim Justice, the governor of West Virginia, did express opposition to the Right to Work law when it was passed in his state in 2016. However, it's important to note that his opposition was not absolute. He stated that he would not have signed the bill into law, but he also did not take any action to repeal it once it was passed. Therefore, the statement leaves out important details about his stance."

The availability of footage from a war or conflict depends on many factors, including the presence of journalists and the conditions on the ground.

Additionally, the comparison with Israel is misleading, as the media coverage of different conflicts can vary greatly due to a range of factors."

The fluctuation of real wages is influenced by a variety of factors, including inflation and economic conditions, not just the actions of the president. Furthermore, there have been months where real wages have increased. Therefore, the statement is only partially accurate and leaves out important details."

The Biden administration did call for de-escalation and a ceasefire during the conflict between Israel and Hamas in May 2021. However, saying they ""wanted Israel to stand down"" oversimplifies the situation and could be interpreted as the administration taking a side, which is not entirely accurate. The U.S. government's stance was more nuanced, advocating for a reduction in violence and protection of civilians on both sides."
