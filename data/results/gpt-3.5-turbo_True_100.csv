3,Tyler Katzenberger,Says U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin “voted to send hundreds of millions to Iran” to bankroll “radicals like Hezbollah and Hamas.”,National Republican Senatorial Committee,"November 24, 2023",barely-true,mostly-false,"The statement is mostly false because it exaggerates and misrepresents Senator Tammy Baldwin's actions. While it is true that she voted on a bill related to Iran, it is misleading to claim that she specifically voted to send hundreds of millions to Iran to support radicals like Hezbollah and Hamas. The PolitiFact rating confirms that there are two different instances of the U.S. freeing Iranian money, and Baldwin only voted on one of them, which was related to the 2015 nuclear deal. Therefore, the statement ignores critical facts and takes things out of context."

The statement claims that this Thanksgiving dinner is the fourth-cheapest ever as a percentage of average earnings because wages are rising. While it is true that wages are rising, it is important to consider other factors that contribute to the cost of Thanksgiving dinner, such as the prices of food and ingredients. The statement does not provide any information about the prices of food or how they have changed over time. Therefore, it is only partially accurate and leaves out important details."

The statement claims that an exemption in a new Florida law allowed Chinese nationals to buy land within a 20-mile radius of a military base, and that this exemption was lobbied for by one of Governor Ron DeSantis' donors. 

Based on the search results, it is true that there was an exemption in a new Florida law that allowed Chinese nationals to buy land within a 20-mile radius of a military base. However, it is important to note that this exemption was not specifically lobbied for by one of Governor Ron DeSantis' donors. The article does not provide any evidence or information to support this claim. Therefore, the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details regarding the lobbying aspect."

The statement refers to a promise made by the United States to Ukraine in 1992. It states that if Ukraine returned nuclear missiles to Russia, and Russia were to invade Ukraine, the United States would protect Ukraine. This promise is known as the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. 

The statement is mostly true because the Budapest Memorandum did indeed involve a promise of security assurances to Ukraine in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons. However, it is important to note that the memorandum was not a formal treaty and did not guarantee military intervention by the United States in the event of an invasion. The memorandum was signed by the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and it provided assurances of respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. While the United States did condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and provided some military assistance to Ukraine, it did not fulfill the promise of direct military protection. Therefore, the statement is mostly true but needs clarification regarding the limitations of the security assurances provided by the Budapest Memorandum."

However, there is no evidence or information provided in the search results or the statement itself to support this claim.

The statement accurately states that over the past four decades, America has lost over 400,000 farms and over 140 million acres of farmland. However, it fails to provide important context such as the reasons behind the loss of farms and farmland. Factors such as urbanization, consolidation of farms, and changes in agricultural practices have contributed to this loss. Additionally, the comparison to the size of Minnesota, North and South Dakota combined is meant to provide a visual representation of the area lost but does not provide a complete understanding of the impact."

Adrenochrome conspiracy theories have been debunked and are often associated with antisemitic beliefs. The search results also indicate that the supposed evidence provided in the photos is actually a result of photo filters designed to alter the appearance of the actor.

He has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984 and has played a significant role in advising the U.S. government during public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The claim that he doesn't exist is baseless and lacks any evidence."
88,Louis Jacobson,“Gen Z is divided 50-50 on whether they support Hamas or Israel.”,Vivek Ramaswamy,"November 2, 2023",barely-true,mostly-false,"The statement is mostly false because it exaggerates the level of division among Gen Z regarding their support for Hamas or Israel.

The statement claims that gasoline prices are ""up 63%"" under President Joe Biden. However, without additional information or context, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim. Gasoline prices can be influenced by various factors such as global oil prices, supply and demand, and geopolitical events. It is important to consider these factors before attributing any changes in gasoline prices solely to the actions of a specific president. Additionally, the statement does not provide any comparison to previous prices or a specific time frame, making it difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim. A web search did not provide any specific information or data to support or refute the claim. Therefore, the statement is classified as half-true."

Based on the statement made by Laura Schulte, she claims that Wisconsin has historically been a blue state and largely continues to be. While it is true that Wisconsin has a history of leaning towards the Democratic Party, it is important to note that the state has also had periods of Republican dominance. In recent years, Wisconsin has been considered a swing state, with both Democrats and Republicans winning elections.

The statement claims that when the speaker came into office, Iran had $70 billion in foreign exchange reserves and by the time they left, Iran had nothing and was broke.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Iran's foreign exchange reserves were estimated to be around $120 billion in 2013, before the speaker came into office. However, due to economic sanctions and other factors, Iran's reserves did decrease over time. As of 2021, Iran's foreign exchange reserves were estimated to be around $80 billion. Therefore, the statement exaggerates the situation by claiming that Iran had nothing when the speaker left office."

This is not entirely accurate. While it is true that a government shutdown can lead to the temporary suspension of non-essential government services, essential services such as food stamps, transportation, education, justice, environmental protection, and homelessness programs are typically considered essential and continue to operate during a shutdown, albeit with potential disruptions or delays.
