3,Tyler Katzenberger,Says U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin “voted to send hundreds of millions to Iran” to bankroll “radicals like Hezbollah and Hamas.”,National Republican Senatorial Committee,"November 24, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Senator Tammy Baldwin did vote in favor of the Iran nuclear deal, which did result in Iran gaining access to frozen assets. However, it's misleading to say she voted to ""send hundreds of millions to Iran"" as if it was a direct transaction. Furthermore, the claim that this money was used to bankroll ""radicals like Hezbollah and Hamas"" is speculative and not directly supported by evidence."
7,Louis Jacobson,"“Because wages are rising, this Thanksgiving dinner is the fourth-cheapest ever as a percentage of average earnings.”",Karine Jean-Pierre,"November 21, 2023",mostly-true,Mostly-true,"The statement is accurate in suggesting that the cost of Thanksgiving dinner can be influenced by wage levels. However, it lacks specific data or sources to verify the claim that this particular Thanksgiving dinner is the ""fourth-cheapest ever as a percentage of average earnings."" Without this information, it's difficult to fully confirm the accuracy of the statement."
15,Jeff Cercone,These 13 books “have been banned from schools in Florida.”,Pink,"November 20, 2023",barely-true,mostly-true,"The statement is mostly true because there have been instances where books have been banned from schools in Florida. However, without specifying which 13 books are being referred to, it's difficult to confirm the accuracy of the statement. The banning of books can vary from district to district, and it's not a statewide policy. Therefore, additional information or clarification is needed."
16,Louis Jacobson,"""Half of American high school students are not familiar with the Holocaust.""",Dean Phillips,"November 20, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it's true that some surveys have shown a lack of knowledge about the Holocaust among American high school students, the claim that ""half"" are not familiar is not universally supported by all data. The percentage can vary widely depending on the specific survey and the questions asked."
18,Ciara O'Rourke,Princess Diana “is still alive” and “possibly could be with Trump.”,Viral image,"November 17, 2023",pants-fire,pants-fire,"The claim that Princess Diana is still alive and could possibly be with Trump is not only false, but it also makes a ridiculous claim. Princess Diana died in a car crash in 1997, which is a well-documented fact. There is no credible evidence to support the claim that she is still alive or that she is with Trump."
23,Sophia Voight,"U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson ""opposes Social Security benefits.""",Francesca Hong,"November 17, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Mike Johnson may have opposed certain aspects or reforms of Social Security, but it's unlikely that he opposes the entire concept of Social Security benefits. The statement needs more context to be fully understood."
24,Maria Briceño,Ron DeSantis “wants to cut Social Security and Medicare.”,DeSantis Watch,"November 16, 2023",barely-true,half-true,"While it's true that Ron DeSantis has supported policies that could lead to cuts in Social Security and Medicare, it's not accurate to say he ""wants"" to cut these programs. This statement leaves out important context about his overall stance on these issues."
25,Louis Jacobson,“Abraham Lincoln challenged a guy to a sword fight.”,Markwayne Mullin,"November 16, 2023",half-true,Mostly-true,"While it sounds like a tall tale, there is historical evidence that Abraham Lincoln, before he became president, was involved in a duel with James Shields in 1842. However, it's important to note that the duel never actually took place, as friends intervened and resolved the dispute before any fighting occurred. Also, it was a customary duel with cavalry broadswords, not a spontaneous ""sword fight"" as the statement might suggest."
30,Ciara O'Rourke,"Video shows first lady Jill Biden calling President Joe Biden “the world's biggest cheerleader for the atrocities happening now in Gaza.""",Viral image,"November 15, 2023",pants-fire,false,"There is no evidence or credible source that supports the claim that Jill Biden referred to President Joe Biden as ""the world's biggest cheerleader for the atrocities happening now in Gaza."" This statement seems to be a fabrication or misinterpretation."
31,Louis Jacobson,"“Last year alone, natural disasters in America caused $178 billion in damages.”",Joe Biden,"November 15, 2023",mostly-true,mostly-true,"The statement is accurate in that natural disasters can cause significant damage and result in billions of dollars in costs. However, without specific data from the mentioned year, it's hard to confirm the exact figure of $178 billion. The amount can vary greatly from year to year depending on the severity and frequency of the disasters."
