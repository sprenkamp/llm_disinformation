3,Tyler Katzenberger,Says U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin “voted to send hundreds of millions to Iran” to bankroll “radicals like Hezbollah and Hamas.”,National Republican Senatorial Committee,"November 24, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate. U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin did vote in favor of the Iran nuclear deal, which did release previously frozen Iranian assets. However, it's misleading to say she voted to ""send hundreds of millions to Iran"" as if it was a direct payment. Furthermore, the claim that this money was used to bankroll ""radicals like Hezbollah and Hamas"" is speculative and lacks direct evidence."
7,Louis Jacobson,"“Because wages are rising, this Thanksgiving dinner is the fourth-cheapest ever as a percentage of average earnings.”",Karine Jean-Pierre,"November 21, 2023",mostly-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is likely accurate as it is made by a credible source, but it lacks specific data or sources to fully verify the claim. The cost of Thanksgiving dinner and average earnings can vary widely depending on various factors, so without specific data, it's hard to confirm the exact ranking of this year's Thanksgiving dinner cost as a percentage of average earnings."
15,Jeff Cercone,These 13 books “have been banned from schools in Florida.”,Pink,"November 20, 2023",barely-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is likely accurate, as books are often banned from schools for various reasons, such as explicit content, controversial themes, or inappropriate language. However, without a list of the specific books and the reasons they were banned, it's hard to fully verify the claim. The statement could be improved with more detailed information."
16,Louis Jacobson,"""Half of American high school students are not familiar with the Holocaust.""",Dean Phillips,"November 20, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it is true that there are concerns about the level of Holocaust education in American high schools, stating that ""half"" of students are not familiar with it is a broad generalization. The level of knowledge can vary greatly depending on the curriculum, the state, and the individual school. It would be more accurate to say that there are significant numbers of students who are not adequately educated about the Holocaust, but without specific data, it's misleading to claim that half are not familiar with it."
18,Ciara O'Rourke,Princess Diana “is still alive” and “possibly could be with Trump.”,Viral image,"November 17, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The claim is not only false but also makes a ridiculous assertion. Princess Diana died in a car crash in 1997, a fact that is widely known and documented. The suggestion that she could be with Trump is also baseless and without any credible evidence."
23,Sophia Voight,"U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson ""opposes Social Security benefits.""",Francesca Hong,"November 17, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Without context, it's hard to determine what is meant by ""opposes Social Security benefits."" It could mean that Mike Johnson opposes the current system, wants to reform it, or wants to eliminate it entirely. Without further information, it's impossible to fully assess the accuracy of this statement."
24,Maria Briceño,Ron DeSantis “wants to cut Social Security and Medicare.”,DeSantis Watch,"November 16, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has expressed support for reforms to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, which could include cuts. However, it's not accurate to say he ""wants to cut"" these programs without providing the context that he believes such measures may be necessary to ensure their long-term solvency."
25,Louis Jacobson,“Abraham Lincoln challenged a guy to a sword fight.”,Markwayne Mullin,"November 16, 2023",half-true,"Mostly-true -> While it sounds unusual, there is historical evidence that Abraham Lincoln was challenged to a duel by James Shields in 1842. However, it's important to note that Lincoln did not initiate the challenge, but he did choose broadswords as the weapon for the duel. The duel never took place as friends intervened and resolved the issue. So, the statement is mostly true but needs clarification on who initiated the challenge and the outcome of the duel."
30,Ciara O'Rourke,"Video shows first lady Jill Biden calling President Joe Biden “the world's biggest cheerleader for the atrocities happening now in Gaza.""",Viral image,"November 15, 2023",pants-fire,"false -> There is no evidence or credible source to support the claim that Jill Biden referred to President Joe Biden as ""the world's biggest cheerleader for the atrocities happening now in Gaza."" This statement seems to be a fabrication or misinterpretation."
31,Louis Jacobson,"“Last year alone, natural disasters in America caused $178 billion in damages.”",Joe Biden,"November 15, 2023",mostly-true,"I'm sorry, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time data or the ability to access future data. As of my last update in October 2021, I can't verify the accuracy of this statement made by Louis Jacobson on November 15, 2023. Therefore, I can't classify this statement."
33,Paul Specht,“This map was drawn entirely in secret by an Ohio consultant … with taxpayer dollars.”,Eric Ager,"November 15, 2023",mostly-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate as it is possible that a map could be drawn by a consultant in secret. However, it leaves out important details such as what map is being referred to, why it was drawn in secret, and how taxpayer dollars were involved. Without these details, it's hard to fully assess the truthfulness of the statement."
37,Samantha Putterman,"An exemption in a new Florida law “allowed Chinese nationals to buy land within a 20-mile radius of a military base, lobbied for by one of (Gov. Ron DeSantis’) donors.”",Vivek Ramaswamy,"November 15, 2023",half-true,"false -> The statement is not accurate. There is no evidence or credible source to suggest that a new Florida law has an exemption that allows Chinese nationals to buy land within a 20-mile radius of a military base. Furthermore, there is no proof that such a provision was lobbied for by one of Gov. Ron DeSantis' donors."
39,Louis Jacobson,"“We sell arms to 60% of the world's autocrats. We are the world's largest arms exporters.""",Marianne Williamson,"November 14, 2023",true,"mostly-true -> The statement is accurate in that the United States is indeed the world's largest arms exporter. However, the claim that the U.S. sells arms to 60% of the world's autocrats is difficult to verify without a clear definition of who is considered an ""autocrat"" and without specific data on arms sales to these individuals. Therefore, while the statement is largely true, it requires additional information or clarification."
40,Sarah Bahari,“We produce a lot more wind energy in Texas than California does.”,Ted Cruz,"November 14, 2023",true,"True -> Texas is the leading state in the United States for wind energy production. As of 2020, Texas had more than double the installed wind capacity of any other state, including California."
44,Ciara O'Rourke,A “B-2 stealth bomber seen over New York” means “Hezbollah may declare war on Israel.”,TikTok posts,"November 10, 2023",pants-fire,false -> The statement is not accurate because there is no logical or factual connection between a B-2 stealth bomber being seen over New York and Hezbollah declaring war on Israel. The presence of a military aircraft in a specific location does not necessarily indicate a specific geopolitical event or decision.
48,Ciara O'Rourke,“Jews did 9/11.”,Instagram posts,"November 10, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> This statement is not only inaccurate, but it also promotes a harmful and baseless conspiracy theory. The 9/11 attacks were carried out by the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda, as confirmed by multiple credible sources and investigations."
49,Jeff Cercone,Joe Rogan spoke about a child being abducted into a secret Disneyland tunnel.,Instagram posts,"November 9, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> There is no credible evidence or reports to support the claim that a child was abducted into a secret Disneyland tunnel, and Joe Rogan speaking about it. This statement seems to be a conspiracy theory or a fabrication."
50,Louis Jacobson,"“In 1992, this country made a promise to Ukraine. We said if you return nuclear missiles that were part of the old Soviet Union to Russia, and they invade you, we will protect you.”",Chris Christie,"November 9, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate. The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances (1994) does involve Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons. However, the agreement does not explicitly state that the U.S. or other signatories would militarily protect Ukraine in the event of an invasion. It does affirm commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine and refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. The specifics of the ""protection"" are not clearly defined."
52,Ciara O'Rourke,Video shows someone wearing a Donald Trump mask appeared in court instead of the former president.,Viral image,"November 9, 2023",pants-fire,False -> The statement is not accurate. There is no credible record or news report that someone wearing a Donald Trump mask appeared in court instead of the former president. This would be a serious breach of legal protocol and would have been widely reported.
57,Jeff Cercone,"""Acapulco destroyed by yet another directed weather attack!”",Instagram posts,"November 9, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The statement makes a ridiculous claim about ""directed weather attacks"", which implies a conspiracy theory. There is no scientific evidence or consensus that supports the idea of controlling weather to the point of directing it to cause destruction in specific locations."
58,Tyler Katzenberger,Wisconsin elections administrator Meagan Wolfe “refuses to clean up our voter rolls”,"Wisconsin Election Committee, Inc .","November 8, 2023",pants-fire,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate. Meagan Wolfe, as Wisconsin's chief election official, does have a role in maintaining the state's voter rolls. However, the process of ""cleaning up"" voter rolls is not solely within her control. It involves a complex process that includes local election officials and state laws. The statement leaves out these important details, giving the impression that Wolfe alone is responsible for the state of Wisconsin's voter rolls."
60,Tyler Katzenberger,Wisconsin elections administrator Meagan Wolfe “permitted the ‘Zuckerbucks’ influence money.”,"Wisconsin Election Committee, Inc .","November 8, 2023",pants-fire,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate. It is true that Wisconsin, like many other states, received funding from the Center for Tech and Civic Life, a nonprofit that distributed hundreds of millions of dollars in grants for the 2020 election, much of it coming from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan. However, the term ""Zuckerbucks"" is a pejorative term used by some critics of this funding, and the implication that Meagan Wolfe, the state's top election official, personally ""permitted"" this funding is misleading. The funding was accepted at a state level, not by Wolfe individually. Furthermore, the funds were used to facilitate the election process, not to influence the outcome."
63,Ciara O'Rourke,“NASA admits space and planets are fake.”,Viral image,"November 8, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is a U.S. government agency that conducts space exploration and research. It has never claimed that space and planets are fake. This is a conspiracy theory with no basis in fact."
67,Louis Jacobson,"""Over the past four decades, we’ve lost over 400,000 farms in America (and) over 140 million acres of farmland. And that’s an area roughly equal to the size of Minnesota, North and South Dakota combined.”",Joe Biden,"November 7, 2023",mostly-true,"Mostly-true -> The statement is accurate in terms of the number of farms lost in America over the past four decades. However, the comparison of the lost farmland to the size of Minnesota, North and South Dakota combined needs further clarification or additional information. The exact size of these states and the total area of lost farmland should be specified for a more accurate comparison."
69,Hope Karnopp,Some individuals or businesses in Wisconsin are charging $2 or $2.25 an hour for child care.,"Rachael Cabral-Guevara,","November 7, 2023",mostly-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it's possible that some individuals or businesses in Wisconsin may charge as low as $2 or $2.25 an hour for child care, it's not the standard or average rate. Child care costs can vary widely depending on various factors such as location, the age of the child, and the type of care. Without additional context or information, this statement could give a misleading impression about the cost of child care in Wisconsin."
71,Ciara O'Rourke,Video shows someone impersonating President Joe Biden visiting Israel in October 2023.,Viral image,"November 7, 2023",pants-fire,false -> The statement is not accurate because there is no evidence or credible source provided to support the claim that someone impersonated President Joe Biden visiting Israel in October 2023.
72,Ciara O'Rourke,Photos are evidence actor Courteney Cox uses adrenochrome from kidnapped children.,Instagram posts,"November 7, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The statement makes a ridiculous and unfounded claim. There is no credible evidence or reliable source to support the assertion that Courteney Cox, or anyone else, uses adrenochrome from kidnapped children. This is a conspiracy theory that has been widely debunked."
77,Louis Jacobson,“Because of our economic policies we now are reducing inflation.”,Kamala Harris,"November 3, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate as economic policies can indeed influence inflation. However, without specific details about which policies are being referred to and how they are directly leading to reduced inflation, the statement is lacking important context."
84,Sophia Voight,"Potato chips, KitKat bars and Viagra are not taxed in Wisconsin because they are considered ""essential.""",Melissa Agard,"November 3, 2023",true,"Mostly-true -> While it's true that some states in the U.S., including Wisconsin, do not tax certain food items and prescription drugs, the classification of these items as ""essential"" may vary. The statement is accurate in that potato chips and KitKat bars (as food items) and Viagra (as a prescription drug) may not be taxed. However, the term ""essential"" is subjective and may need further clarification. For instance, while prescription drugs like Viagra could be considered essential for some individuals, categorizing potato chips and KitKat bars as ""essential"" could be misleading."
85,Grace Abels,Republicans in Congress are “trying to wipe out federal funding to end the HIV epidemic.”,Joe Biden,"November 3, 2023",half-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it's possible that some Republicans in Congress may have proposed cuts to certain programs related to HIV, it's a broad generalization to say that they are ""trying to wipe out federal funding to end the HIV epidemic."" The statement does not provide specific details about which Republicans, which programs, and how much funding is at stake."
87,Ciara O'Rourke,“Dr. Fauci doesn’t exist!”,Instagram posts,"November 2, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Dr. Anthony Fauci is a well-known public figure, serving as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). His existence is not a matter of debate or opinion."
88,Louis Jacobson,“Gen Z is divided 50-50 on whether they support Hamas or Israel.”,Vivek Ramaswamy,"November 2, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. The author does not provide any source or data to back up the claim. Moreover, the views of an entire generation like Gen Z can vary greatly depending on many factors such as location, upbringing, education, etc. Therefore, it's unlikely that the entire Gen Z population is divided exactly 50-50 on such a complex issue."
89,Anthony Starkey,"Gasoline prices are ""up 63%"" under President Joe Biden.",Chris Rose,"November 2, 2023",half-true,"half-true -> While it's possible that gasoline prices have increased under President Joe Biden's administration, attributing the entire 63% increase to his policies is misleading. Gasoline prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global oil prices, supply and demand, and geopolitical events, which are beyond the control of any single administration."
92,Grace Abels,“Every President we ever had in the United States of America was a draconian reptilian.”,Facebook posts,"November 1, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The statement makes a ridiculous claim that every U.S. President was a ""draconian reptilian,"" which is a conspiracy theory with no basis in fact."
93,Amy Sherman,Gov. Ron DeSantis “actually sponsored the bill to make Puerto Rico a state.”,MAGA Inc,"November 1, 2023",mostly-true,"mostly-true -> While it's true that Ron DeSantis, as a U.S. Representative, co-sponsored a bill in 2018 that would have made Puerto Rico a state, the statement could use some clarification. The bill, known as the Puerto Rico Admission Act, was not solely sponsored by DeSantis but was a bipartisan effort. Also, it's important to note that the bill did not pass. Therefore, while DeSantis did support statehood for Puerto Rico, the statement might give the impression that he was the sole sponsor and that the bill was successful, which is not the case."
94,Louis Jacobson,"China is “the largest developer of neuro-strike weapons, weapons engineered to change the brain activity of military commanders and segments of the population.”",Nikki Haley,"November 1, 2023",mostly-true,"false -> The statement is not accurate. There is no credible evidence or widely accepted reports to suggest that China is developing ""neuro-strike weapons"" designed to alter brain activity. This claim seems to be speculative and lacks substantiation."
105,Amy Sherman,“The Republicans and Trump funded $400 million in March of 2020 for mail ballots.”,Ron DeSantis,"October 31, 2023",half-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is mostly accurate. The CARES Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in March 2020, did include $400 million in funding for election security grants, which could be used to help states expand their mail-in voting systems. However, the statement could use some clarification. The funding was not specifically earmarked for mail ballots, but rather for a broader range of election security measures. Furthermore, the funding was approved by Congress, which includes both Republicans and Democrats, not just the Republicans and Trump."
107,Laura Schulte,"“Wisconsin has historically … and I think largely continues to be, a blue state.”",Scott Walker,"October 31, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Wisconsin has a history of voting for both Democratic and Republican candidates in various elections. While it has leaned Democratic in some presidential elections, it has also elected Republican governors and has voted for Republican presidential candidates, including in the 2016 election. Therefore, calling it a ""blue state"" is not entirely accurate without further context."
115,Louis Jacobson,“It is harder to buy Sudafed than an AR-15 in Maine.”,Shannon Watts,"October 27, 2023",half-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it's true that purchasing Sudafed, a common cold medication, is regulated due to its potential use in manufacturing methamphetamine, implying that it's harder to buy than an AR-15 rifle is misleading. The purchase of an AR-15 also involves regulations, including background checks. However, the specifics can vary greatly depending on the circumstances of the purchase (e.g., private sale vs. licensed dealer, state laws, etc.). Therefore, the comparison is not as straightforward as the statement suggests."
117,Ricardo Torres,"The Milwaukee Brewers “are complaining about a lack of transit going to the ballpark at the same time as they are testifying in favor (of) taking $135 million away from Milwaukee County, which funds transit.""",Chris Larson,"October 27, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate. While it is true that the Milwaukee Brewers have expressed concerns about transit to the ballpark, it is not entirely clear if they are directly advocating for taking $135 million away from Milwaukee County, which funds transit. The connection between these two issues is not explicitly stated, and the context is missing."
119,Ciara O'Rourke,Video shows a President Joe Biden impostor.,Viral image,"October 27, 2023",pants-fire,"false -> Without any specific video or context provided, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. It's also important to note that video technology can be manipulated, so even if such a video exists, it doesn't necessarily mean that there's an actual Joe Biden impostor."
120,Louis Jacobson,“Prices have increased over 17% in the last two years.”,Mike Johnson,"October 26, 2023",half-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is likely accurate, but it lacks context. It doesn't specify what prices (for example, gas, groceries, housing, etc.) have increased. Without this information, it's hard to fully assess the truth of the claim."
121,Louis Jacobson,"“In the time it’s going to take me to deliver this speech, we’ll go up another $20 million in debt.”",Mike Johnson,"October 26, 2023",mostly-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate. While it's true that the U.S. national debt is increasing, the rate of increase is not constant and can vary based on a number of factors. Therefore, without specific context or time frame for the speech, it's hard to verify the exact amount of debt increase."
123,Louis Jacobson,"“When I came into office, Iran had $70 billion in foreign exchange reserves. … By the time I left, they had nothing. They were broke.”",Donald Trump,"October 26, 2023",half-true,"false -> The statement is not accurate. Louis Jacobson is a journalist and not a political figure who would have the power to influence Iran's foreign exchange reserves. Furthermore, the claim that Iran was left with no foreign exchange reserves is highly unlikely and would need substantial evidence to support."
124,Madeline Heim,"""The repeal of Roe v. Wade has exacerbated the state’s OB-GYN shortage as residency programs report a decline in enrollment due to the inability of residents to receive training in-state.""",Opportunity Wisconsin,"October 25, 2023",half-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is plausible as the repeal of Roe v. Wade could potentially lead to a decline in OB-GYN residency enrollment due to the inability to receive certain types of training in-state. However, the statement could use additional information or clarification to confirm the direct correlation between the repeal and the decline in enrollment. It would be helpful to have specific data or studies to back up this claim."
129,Hope Karnopp,"“Since 1981, the state Senate has only rejected five executive appointments. The GOP today is more than doubling that number.”",Melissa Agard,"October 25, 2023",true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Without knowing the exact number of executive appointments the GOP is rejecting, it's impossible to confirm if they are ""more than doubling"" the number of rejections since 1981. The statement also lacks context about why these rejections are happening."
132,Marta Campabadal,Este video muestra al Dr. Juan Rivera hablando sobre un medicamento para la artritis y la artrosis.,Facebook posts,"• October 24,",pants-fire,"I'm sorry, but I can't classify this statement without additional information such as the content of the video, the claims made by Dr. Juan Rivera, and the context in which the statement was made."
134,Aidan Cornue,"Sen. Joe Manchin’s “support for the (Inflation Reduction Act) could cost West Virginia 100,000 fossil fuel jobs.”",One Nation,"October 24, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate as Sen. Joe Manchin's support for the Inflation Reduction Act could potentially impact fossil fuel jobs in West Virginia. However, the specific number of 100,000 jobs is not substantiated and may be an exaggeration or speculation. The actual impact would depend on various factors including the specifics of the legislation, the current state of the fossil fuel industry, and the economy of West Virginia."
136,Madison Ely,"Jim Justice ""opposes the Right to Work”",Alex Mooney,"October 24, 2023",barely-true,"mostly-true -> Jim Justice, the Governor of West Virginia, has expressed his opposition to the Right to Work law in the past. However, it's important to note that his stance may have changed over time or may vary depending on the specific context or provisions of the law. Therefore, while the statement is generally accurate, it may require further clarification or additional information."
143,Louis Jacobson,"""Russia has hypersonic missile capabilities ahead of that of the U.S.”",Vivek Ramaswamy,"October 20, 2023",half-true,"mostly-true -> While it is true that Russia has been developing hypersonic missile technology and has claimed to have operational hypersonic missiles, it is also important to note that the U.S. is also developing similar technology. The statement could be misleading without this additional context."
146,Maria Ramirez,"“In the last 11 months, Customs and Border Patrol has averaged 200,000 apprehensions a month, and you know how many beds we have to detain people at the border? Thirty-eight thousand.""",Chris Christie,"• October 20,",mostly-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is mostly accurate. The number of apprehensions at the border can vary greatly from month to month, but it has reached 200,000 in some months. The number of beds available for detention is also generally accurate, but it can fluctuate depending on various factors such as funding and policy changes. However, the statement could use some clarification or additional information, such as the fact that not all apprehended individuals are detained, and many are released into the U.S. pending immigration proceedings."
150,Max Cohen,“2022 was the biggest tourism year ever in West Virginia”,Jim Justice,"October 20, 2023",half-true,"false -> The statement is not accurate because as of the current date, we do not have the data for tourism in West Virginia for the year 2022."
153,Anthony Starkey,“The Inflation Reduction Act led to higher taxes.”,Americans for Prosperity,"October 19, 2023",barely-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is mostly true as the Inflation Reduction Act may have led to higher taxes. However, it needs clarification or additional information because the Act's impact on taxes can vary depending on the specific provisions of the Act, the economic context, and other factors."
154,Ashala Moseberry,"""Credit card debt is above $1 trillion for the FIRST TIME EVER.""",Jim Justice,"October 19, 2023",mostly-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is accurate in that credit card debt in the United States has indeed surpassed $1 trillion. However, it needs clarification as it is not the first time ever. The credit card debt in the U.S. first surpassed $1 trillion in 2017."
160,Tyler Katzenberger,"There are ""about a half a dozen"" transgender athletes competing in Wisconsin K-12 schools.",Barbara Dittrich,"October 18, 2023",barely-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is likely accurate, but without specific data or sources to confirm the exact number of transgender athletes in Wisconsin K-12 schools, it's hard to say for certain. The phrase ""about a half a dozen"" suggests an estimate rather than a precise count."
161,Sara Swann,“Lego donates model MRI kits to hospitals to help children understand the procedure and reduce their anxiety.”,Instagram posts,"October 18, 2023",true,"Mostly-true -> While it is true that Lego has created model MRI kits, it is not clear from the statement whether these kits are specifically donated to hospitals or if they are available for purchase by hospitals or individuals. Additional information or clarification is needed to fully verify the claim."
162,Amy Sherman,The Democrats are pushing “to take in a million Palestinian refugees.”,Andy Biggs,"October 18, 2023",pants-fire,false -> The statement is not accurate. There is no evidence or policy proposal from the Democratic party that suggests they are pushing to take in a million Palestinian refugees. This seems to be a misrepresentation or misunderstanding of the party's stance on immigration and refugee issues.
168,Loreben Tuquero,“There isn't a single video or photo suggesting that 250 people were killed (by Hamas) at a concert or that a mass shooting took place” on Oct. 7 in Israel.,Instagram posts,"October 13, 2023",pants-fire,false -> The statement is not accurate. There is no record or news report of such an incident happening in Israel on the mentioned date.
169,Jeff Cercone,Biden is “funding every angle” of the Israel-Hamas war.,Instagram posts,"October 13, 2023",barely-true,"false -> The statement is not accurate. While the U.S. does provide military aid to Israel, it does not fund Hamas, a group it has designated as a terrorist organization. The claim that Biden is funding ""every angle"" of the Israel-Hamas war is therefore false."
171,Amy Sherman,"It has been U.S. policy “for at least 79 years"" to require Americans who intend to be evacuated from overseas to sign a promissory note.",Brian Krassenstein,"October 13, 2023",true,"mostly-true -> The statement is mostly accurate. The U.S. State Department has a policy that requires U.S. citizens evacuated from overseas to sign a promissory note, agreeing to repay the cost of their evacuation. However, the specific duration of ""at least 79 years"" may need further verification or clarification. The policy is not new and has been in place for many years, but the exact number of years might be different."
172,Sara Swann,Less than 48 hours after Israel was attacked “we have hundreds of hours worth of footage but zero footage from the Ukraine war.”,Instagram posts,"October 13, 2023",pants-fire,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it's possible that there could be hundreds of hours of footage from the Israel attack, the claim that there is zero footage from the Ukraine war is unlikely. Even if mainstream media doesn't cover it extensively, there are usually independent journalists, citizens, and other sources that capture and share footage. However, without specific context or sources, it's hard to fully verify or debunk this claim."
175,Ciara O'Rourke,The 2023 Israel-Hamas war is a “false flag.”,Instagram posts,"October 13, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim including a conspiracy. The term ""false flag"" is often used to describe covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them. This statement is suggesting a conspiracy theory without providing any evidence or context."
184,Ciara O'Rourke,“Kamala Harris is not a ‘natural born citizen’” and “can’t be president.”,Viral image,"October 12, 2023",pants-fire,"false -> Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, California, which makes her a natural-born U.S. citizen. The U.S. Constitution states that any person born in the United States is a natural-born citizen, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. Therefore, she is eligible to serve as President of the United States."
186,Maria Ramirez,"“The same people that raided Israel are pouring into our once beautiful USA, through our TOTALLY OPEN SOUTHERN BORDER, at Record Numbers.”",Donald Trump,"• October 12,",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. There is no evidence to support the claim that the people who ""raided"" Israel are the same ones entering the USA through the southern border. Additionally, the southern border is not ""totally open"", as there are numerous border control measures in place."
187,Jacquie Broush,“Since Biden took office ... real wages have fallen monthly.”,West Virginia Republican Party,"October 12, 2023",mostly-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is mostly true as real wages have indeed fallen in some months since Biden took office. However, it needs clarification because it does not specify which months and it implies that this has happened every month, which may not be the case. Also, it does not consider other factors that could have contributed to the decrease in real wages."

He now serves in the building he tried to burn down.""",Rebecca Cooke,"October 11, 2023",barely-true,"false -> Derrick Van Orden, a former Navy SEAL, did attend the rally on January 6, 2021, but there is no evidence to suggest that he participated in the insurrection or attempted to burn down the Capitol building. He has publicly stated that he did not enter the Capitol building during the riot. This statement is not accurate."
202,Louis Jacobson,"The Biden administration “wanted Israel to stand down after the attack"" by Hamas.",Tim Scott,"October 10, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate. The Biden administration did call for a ceasefire during the conflict between Israel and Hamas in May 2021. However, the phrase ""wanted Israel to stand down"" might give the impression that the administration was solely blaming Israel for the conflict or was not supportive of Israel's right to self-defense, which is not entirely accurate. The administration's stance was more nuanced, emphasizing both Israel's right to defend itself against rocket attacks and the need to prevent further civilian casualties."
203,Tayler Pillo,West Virginia University has “increased the amount of unfunded institutional aid provided to students and expects this amount to exceed $134 million in 2024.”,Paula Congelio,"October 10, 2023",half-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is likely accurate as it is a projection for the future, but it would need to be verified in 2024 to confirm if the amount of unfunded institutional aid did indeed exceed $134 million."
204,Cody Matorin,E. Gordon Gee’s university projects have increased “WVU’s debt load by 55%.”,West Virginia University Faculty Senate,"October 10, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it may be true that the university's debt load increased during E. Gordon Gee's tenure, it's not clear whether this was solely due to his projects. Other factors could have contributed to the increase in debt. Furthermore, the statement doesn't provide any context about whether this increase in debt was normal or excessive compared to other universities."
206,Griff Bihun,“Fewer than 2% of students are impacted whatsoever by the decisions we're making” to cut the budget.,E. Gordon Gee,"October 10, 2023",barely-true,"mostly-true -> The statement could be true, but it lacks specific details about what budget cuts are being made, what areas they are impacting, and how the author arrived at the 2% figure. Without this information, it's hard to fully verify the claim."
209,Loreben Tuquero,"1,609 scientists signed a declaration saying “There is no climate emergency.”",X posts,"October 9, 2023",barely-true,"mostly-true -> While it is true that a group of scientists signed a declaration stating ""There is no climate emergency,"" it's important to note that this is not the consensus view among scientists. The vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. The statement is accurate but lacks this crucial context."
223,Aubrey Burkhardt,“The percentage of students that are going to college (in West Virginia) has been declining for five years.”,George Zimmerman,"October 6, 2023",mostly-true,"half-true -> Without specific data or statistics to back up this claim, it's difficult to determine the full accuracy of the statement. While it's possible that college enrollment rates in West Virginia have been declining, the statement lacks the necessary context and detail to be fully verified."
224,Michelle Peribanez,“Gas prices have skyrocketed since Joe Biden took office and continue to do so everyday.”,Carol Miller,"October 6, 2023",half-true,"half-true -> While it's true that gas prices may have increased since Joe Biden took office, attributing the rise solely to his presidency is misleading. Gas prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global oil prices, supply and demand, and geopolitical events. It's also unlikely that prices are increasing ""everyday"", as the statement suggests, since gas prices fluctuate regularly."
225,Derek Nastasi,Foreign languages are “not a high priority” nationally,E. Gordon Gee,"October 6, 2023",half-true,"half-true -> The statement is subjective and depends on the context. While it's true that in some areas, such as public education, foreign languages may not be prioritized as much as subjects like math or science, there are many programs and initiatives that promote foreign language learning. However, without specific data or context, it's hard to definitively say whether this statement is entirely true or false."
230,Sophia Voight,"China sends “fentanyl into America killing 80,000 Americans a year.”",Mike Gallagher,"October 6, 2023",half-true,"half-true -> While it is true that a significant amount of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, comes from China and contributes to the opioid crisis in America, the claim that it kills 80,000 Americans a year is not entirely accurate. The number of deaths from fentanyl varies from year to year and is not solely attributable to China. Furthermore, the statement oversimplifies the complex issue of drug trafficking and use, ignoring other sources of fentanyl and factors contributing to the opioid crisis."
236,Ciara O'Rourke,Former President Donald Trump is commander in chief.,Instagram posts,"October 5, 2023",pants-fire,"false -> The statement is not accurate because as of the given date, October 5, 2023, Donald Trump is not the commander in chief. The commander in chief is the current president, and Donald Trump's term ended in January 2021."
238,Ciara O'Rourke,“Trump controls U.S. military.”,Facebook posts,"October 5, 2023",pants-fire,"mostly-true -> The statement is accurate in the sense that as the President of the United States, Donald Trump was the commander-in-chief of the U.S. military. However, it needs clarification that while the president has significant control and authority over the military, he does not have absolute control. Decisions are also influenced by other factors such as military leaders, Congress, and international laws."
241,Sophia Bookwood,“#Bidenomics has led to mortgage rates hitting a 21-year high → over 7%.”,Shelley Moore Capito,"October 5, 2023",mostly-true,"false -> The statement is not accurate. As of the date mentioned, mortgage rates under Biden's administration have not hit a 21-year high of over 7%. The rates have remained relatively low, and any fluctuations are influenced by a variety of factors, not just the president's economic policies."
242,Samuel Russ,"“Just in the last four years, $80 billion in federal funding has come to West Virginia — $22 billion more than we've ever received.”",Joe Manchin,"October 5, 2023",mostly-true,"mostly-true -> The statement seems plausible, but without specific data on federal funding to West Virginia in the past four years and the total amount received before that, it's hard to confirm its complete accuracy. The author should provide sources or references for these figures."

While it's true that E. Gordon Gee served as the president of West Virginia University, without specific data or statistics, it's unclear whether student enrollments have steadily decreased during his presidency. The statement lacks important details to fully verify its accuracy."
244,Ciara O'Rourke,California Gov. Gavin Newsom is “not human.”,Instagram posts,"October 5, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Gavin Newsom is a human being, serving as the Governor of California. This statement seems to be a hyperbolic or metaphorical expression rather than a factual claim."
245,Marta Campabadal,Six million or 7 million people have “come illegally under Biden.”,Ron DeSantis,"• October 4,",barely-true,false -> The statement is not accurate. The number of people who have come illegally under Biden's administration is not as high as 6 or 7 million. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection data does not support this claim.
250,Maria Briceño,Patent shows 5G towers are used for brainwashing.,Facebook posts,"October 3, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The claim that 5G towers are used for brainwashing is a conspiracy theory and is not supported by any credible scientific evidence.

252,Ciara O'Rourke,A fact-check proves Michelle Obama is “a he.”,Facebook posts,"October 3, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> This statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Michelle Obama is a woman, and any claim stating otherwise is false and absurd."
253,Louis Jacobson,"""Since the mid-'90s, this country has been governed by revolving continuing resolution and omnibus spending bill(s). … That is the reason we're $33 trillion in debt.""",Matt Gaetz,"October 2, 2023",half-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate. It's true that the U.S. has often relied on continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills since the mid-'90s. However, attributing the entire $33 trillion debt to these practices oversimplifies the issue. The national debt is a result of a variety of factors, including tax policies, economic recessions, and spending on defense and social programs."
258,Grace Abels,A video shows children disappearing from inside a school bus.,Facebook posts,"September 29, 2023",pants-fire,pants-fire -> The statement makes a ridiculous claim that children are disappearing from inside a school bus.

262,Jeff Cercone,Arizona Senate “indicted” Gov. Katie Hobbs.,TikTok posts,"September 29, 2023",pants-fire,"false -> There is no public record or credible source to confirm that the Arizona Senate has indicted Gov. Katie Hobbs.

268,Louis Jacobson,“We are more energy independent today” under President Joe Biden.,Gavin Newsom,"September 28, 2023",half-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate as the U.S. has made strides in energy independence over the years, but it's not solely due to President Joe Biden's actions. Energy independence is a result of policies and developments over many years, including those of previous administrations. It's also influenced by market factors and technological advancements. Therefore, attributing it entirely to President Biden's tenure is misleading."
272,Maria Briceño,"“Si ganas menos de $50,000 al año” puedes calificar para un crédito de salud y usarlo para “lo que sea”.",Facebook posts,"September 28, 2023",barely-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is partially accurate as it is true that people earning less than $50,000 a year may qualify for health credits.

However, the statement could use some clarification or additional information, such as by whom it was voted the best high school football field in America and in what year."
277,Amy Sherman,“Ron DeSantis is against fracking. He is against drilling.”,Nikki Haley,"September 28, 2023",half-true,"half-true -> Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has expressed opposition to offshore drilling near Florida's coasts. However, his stance on fracking is less clear. While he has made statements suggesting he would support a ban on fracking in Florida, he has also signed a bill that would prevent local governments from banning fracking. Therefore, the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details."
283,Loreben Tuquero,"A video proves U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland faces “a lying charge” after giving a fake number to Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., at a hearing.",Facebook posts,"September 26, 2023",pants-fire,"false -> Without specific details about the video, the hearing, or the ""fake number"" in question, it's impossible to verify this claim.

286,Kylie Tuttle,"“Under Jim Justice,” West Virginia had “the lowest unemployment rate in state history.”",Jim Justice,"September 26, 2023",mostly-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is mostly true as during Jim Justice's tenure as governor, West Virginia did experience a significant decrease in unemployment. However, it's important to note that unemployment rates can be influenced by a variety of factors, not just the actions of a single individual or governor. Therefore, while the statement is accurate, it could benefit from additional context or clarification."
287,Jeff Cercone,"U.S. aid to Ukraine will continue during a government shutdown, but programs for food stamps, transportation, education, justice, environmental protection and homelessness will not.",Instagram posts,"September 26, 2023",half-true,"mostly-true -> The statement is mostly accurate but needs some clarification. During a government shutdown, many federal programs and services are indeed halted or scaled back, including those mentioned. However, not all aid to foreign countries, including Ukraine, is necessarily guaranteed to continue. It depends on the specifics of the shutdown and the funding mechanisms for that aid. Also, some programs like food stamps (SNAP) have contingency plans that can keep them going for a short time."
291,Jeff Cercone,"""Texas teacher fired for reading Diary of Anne Frank to class.”",Randi Weingarten,"September 22, 2023",half-true,"false -> Without any additional information or context, it's impossible to verify this claim. The Diary of Anne Frank is a widely accepted educational resource used in many schools, so it seems unlikely that a teacher would be fired for using it in class. However, without specific details about the school, the teacher, or the circumstances, this statement cannot be confirmed as true."
293,Marta Campabadal,"Since Joe Biden “has taken office, unemployment in our (Latino) community has been cut in half.""",Joe Biden,"• September 22,",mostly-true,"2021
half-true -> While it's true that the unemployment rate among Latinos has decreased since Biden took office, saying it has been ""cut in half"" might be an exaggeration. The exact figures can vary depending on the source and the specific time frame considered. Therefore, the statement is partially accurate but may leave out important details or context."

Roy Cooper is blocking a pioneering school choice bill that would give thousands of low-income parents the funds to allow their kids to get a high-quality education.”,Unleash Prosperity Now,"September 21, 2023",barely-true,"half-true -> The statement is partially accurate. It is true that Gov. Roy Cooper has expressed opposition to school choice bills, which often involve using public funds for private education. However, the statement is misleading in suggesting that this is preventing low-income parents from providing their children with a high-quality education. The quality of education is not solely determined by the type of school (public or private) a child attends. Furthermore, the statement does not provide any context about why Gov. Cooper opposes such bills, which could include concerns about the potential negative impact on public schools."
297,Ciara O'Rourke,Video shows a Federal Emergency Management Agency “concentration camp” in Hawaii.,Facebook posts,"September 21, 2023",pants-fire,"pants-fire -> The claim of FEMA ""concentration camps"" is a long-standing conspiracy theory with no factual basis. FEMA, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is a U.S. government agency tasked with disaster response coordination, not the operation of any form of detention or concentration camps."
